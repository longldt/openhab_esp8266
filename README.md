2. Mosquitto (http://mosquitto.org/), is an open source (BSD licensed) message broker that implements the MQ Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT protocol)
3. Adafruit MQTT Library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MQTT_Library), is Arduino library used as a MQTT client on esp8266_program
4. Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library (https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library), is Arduino Library used for DS18B20 temp sensor on esp8266_program

Thanks all above !!!
